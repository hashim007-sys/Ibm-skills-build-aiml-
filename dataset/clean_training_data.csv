I've been a WordPress Developer for 13 years now. I've worked with big name marketing agencies in midtown Manhattan as well as Philadelphia. I’ve had clients from New York down to Atlanta all the way to Chicago to San Francisco. My biggest project to date was for IBM with a budget of $100 million. I’ve also flexed my remote capabilities by taking on an international client for a startup based in Tokyo which is a 13hr time difference. I'm more than capable of taking on any WordPress role as I’m a proven WP developer who specializes in Full Stacks (FE/BE), Site/Database Migrations, Theme/Plugin Configurations, PSD to HTML and every WordPress task in between.
